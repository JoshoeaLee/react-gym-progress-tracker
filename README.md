# react-gym-progress-tracker
My first full React.js web app inspired by how easy to use React-Bootstrap seemed to use. 
You set goals for certain workouts at the gym and then record your progress.
This app uses your browser's local storage so if you use the same browser (and don't use a VPN/Incognito mode)
then your progress will remain even between different sessions.

Uses props, state, custom hooks (hooks found online: useLocalStorage - https://usehooks.com/useLocalStorage/), 
local storage and context to operate. Styled using React Bootstrap. Deployed using Netlify.

Really solidified my understandings of 'how to think in React.'
